This repository presents hypothetical scenarios based on publicly available information from Mexico's ISO. It is important to note that these scenarios do not reflect or represent the actual operations of ISO but rather serve as a theoretical model projecting patterns and calculations to illustrate potential outcomes. The purpose of comparing these scenarios with similar dimensions to the current system employed in Mexico is to evaluate the mathematical model's performance.

The instance is built from data published by CENACE in Mexico using the limits and offers of generators found in [CENACE Generator Offers](https://www.cenace.gob.mx/Paginas/SIM/Reportes/OfertasMDA.aspx). The demand for the zones is also extracted from the same site. The operating limits of the generators used are as offered; however, the generator's parameters were artificially created (ramps, min-up/down times). We use the transmission network comprising 43 regions projected by PRODESEN [PRODESEN2018](cite:PRODESEN2018). The parameters of reservoirs are created artificially, too.
