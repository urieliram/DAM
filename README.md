This work presents hypothetical scenarios based on publicly available information from Mexico's ISO. It is important to note that these scenarios do not reflect or represent the actual operations of ISO, but rather serve as a theoretical model projecting patterns and calculations to illustrate potential outcomes. The purpose of comparing these scenarios with similar dimensions to the current system employed in Mexico is to evaluate the mathematical model's performance.
